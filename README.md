## Why I chose Bubble Sorting
Bubble Sorting seemed like the easiest to implement. The real puzzle of this task was actually how to get it to work in descending order.
Thanks to an example I found on Beginners Book, I found a way through.

## Flowchart
Here is my flowchart of my thought process(in a rough sense) when I worked on this. I tend to think of everything on the spot, so it's not 100% accurate.

## Summarized explanation
This program will generate a random sequence of 2-20 numbers ranging from 1-50 for each number. The program will then call sortArray() and, in reverse, bubble sort all the numbers in ascending order going from last value smallest to largest value first, producing a sorted array of numbers in descending order. The console will then print the sorted array.
